<a href=https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2020/11/06/columbia-affiliates-donated-far-more-to-biden-but-trump-fares-better-than-in-2016/>Columbia affiliates donated far more to Biden, but Trump fares better than in 2016.</a>.

### **About the numbers**

Contribution data is collected from the Federal Election Commission. FEC data reported only represents donations until October 12, 2020. More recent data was not available at the time of publication. Data for the 2016 cycle included any donations reported from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2016.

Data was scraped and cleaned to include only those donations given by self-identified employees of Columbia. The number of donors was processed to be unique, but the number of donations is not, as a single donor may have made multiple donations to any number of campaigns.

Occupational data was manually sorted into the categories shown. “Faculty” includes adjunct, assistant, and tenure-track professors and deans. “Teaching positions” include lecturers, educators, teachers, instructors, and coaches. “Admin” refers to administrative managers, assistants, directors, and executives in business, communications, media, finance, IT, operations, development, HR, and marketing roles. “Academia and research” refers to historians, chemists, librarians, and postdoctoral researchers. “Medical & health” includes physicians, public health experts, and medical researchers. “Undergraduates” also refers to unspecified interns and work-study recipients. “Graduate students” include doctoral and masters students as well as unspecified teaching assistants. **Occupations data (sorted and unsorted) can be found in respective folder.**
